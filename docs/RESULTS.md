Detailed results now live in `../sequence-editing-report/RESULTS.md` and the
ongoing LaTeX report `../sequence-editing-report/report.tex`.

## Current Key Result

Grid 3A local value-only action injection finished. Direct local injection
strongly outperformed the old global-broadcast action conditioning on the small
online Sudoku planning eval.

| Run | Step | Eval loss | Mean rank | H1/H2/H4 solve |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `sudoku_jepa_5m_local_direct_uniform` | 5000 | 0.000187 | 15.96875 | 1.0 / 1.0 / 1.0 |
| `sudoku_jepa_5m_local_direct_weighted` | 5000 | 0.0000639 | 16.25 | 1.0 / 1.0 / 1.0 |
| `sudoku_jepa_5m_local_residual_weighted` | 5000 | 0.00234 | 115.96875 | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 |
| `sudoku_jepa_5m_local_direct_changed_only` | 5000 | 0.11818 | 246.53125 | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 |

All four roots have final `metrics.json`, `metrics.jsonl`, and `checkpoint.pt`.
The first dependent diagnostics array `3674779_[0-3]` failed because the wrapper
passed comma-separated `--horizons`; after a local fix and smoke test,
diagnostics were resubmitted as `3676904_[0-3]`. Treat the online solve signal
as preliminary until those diagnostics finish.

## Prior Read

- Grid 1 diagnostics showed true re-encoded oracle states were monotonic toward
  the goal, while predicted latent rollouts drifted badly.
- Grid 2A rollout training improved 10/20-step drift but worsened action rank
  and did not fix terminal planning.
- The current hypothesis is that local action injection fixes a major action
  grounding failure caused by global action broadcast.
