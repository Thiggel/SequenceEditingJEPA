## Current Operational Read

Grid 3B rollout `N=2` improved proximity, but it did not satisfy the pure
latent exact-solve gate. Job `3680021` reports latent terminal-energy planning
solve `4/64`, filled-board terminal rate `26/64`, and mean remaining Hamming
`2.453`. Re-encoded symbolic-state planning still solves `64/64`.

Compared with the lead large diagnostics (`3680019`), rollout `N=2` cuts
terminal-energy mismatches from 299 to 157 and reduces drift at 10/20 oracle
steps from `0.079/1.742` to `0.041/1.495`. Terminal weighted latent drift is
not fixed (`2.014 -> 2.163`), so the main interpretation still holds: under
oracle-goal diagnostics, the action scorer is sufficient when candidate boards
are re-encoded, while stale latent rollout remains the bottleneck. The result
is not deployable because it still uses the oracle goal and because latent and
re-encoded planner samples are not paired example-by-example.

Grid 3C reset-cadence diagnostics (`3682924`) passed the mechanism gate, and
Grid 3D reset-large confirmation (`3683903`) confirmed it on a larger paired
sample. On 128 paired boards, no-reset terminal-energy planning solved `7/128`
with mean remaining Hamming `2.398`, reset every 4 solved `128/128` under both
step- and terminal-energy selection, reset every 8 solved `91/128` under
step-energy but `128/128` under terminal-energy selection, and full re-encoded
planning solved `128/128`.

Planning intentionally allows overwrites/conflicts on mutable Sudoku cells for
diagnosis, so terminal boards can be fully filled but wrong. Treat online
H1/H2/H4, terminal fill rate, and oracle-goal reset results as diagnostics, not
deployable solve quality. Generated analysis artifacts live under
`../sequence-editing-report/assets/grid3b/`, including the new Grid 3D
reset-large planning plots, CSVs, and concrete paired examples. The decision
gate is now satisfied for implementing a planner-state reset/re-encoding
branch that keeps symbolic candidate boards as the state of record and
re-encodes latents every 4 actions.

Oversight chain issue: successor oversight `3684889` failed with `NODE_FAIL`
after 34 seconds on `a0731`; there was no application stderr. Replacement
oversight `3687722` was submitted with `--begin=now+4hours` and is pending for
`2026-06-01 12:56:38 CEST`. There are no active puzzle-JEPA jobs in `squeue`;
other visible HFSA/paired user-account arrays are outside this repo snapshot.
Partition housekeeping at 10:37 CEST: `3687722` is begin-time-blocked, so
partition broadening cannot help.

Implementation update: the user-directed Grid 4A branch is implemented but not
submitted. It adds a CLS goal-energy head, optional multi-level JEPA predictors,
hierarchy training loss, categorical CEM diagnostics, and configs/scripts for
`sudoku_jepa_5m_goal_energy_cem_l{1,2,3}`. Focused validation passed under the
repo venv:

```bash
source scripts/env.sh
python -m pytest -q tests/test_puzzle_models.py tests/test_puzzle_hydra.py
```

Submit the proposed Grid 4A training array only when ready to spend the GPU
budget:

```bash
sbatch scripts/slurm/run_grid4a_goal_energy_hierarchy.slurm
```

After those checkpoints exist, run:

```bash
sbatch scripts/slurm/run_grid4a_cem_diagnostics.slurm
```

Oversight uses `scripts/oversight/puzzle_oversight_prompt.md`. That prompt
requires each run to reconcile Slurm/artifacts with the backlog, inspect
concrete planner examples, question assumptions, add useful report figures and
tables, fix/resubmit small failures, and keep the four-hour oversight chain
alive. The next safe experiment is the Grid 4A goal-energy/hierarchy/CEM grid;
keep the oracle-goal reset result as the control baseline and do not start Maze
or broad capacity sweeps yet.
