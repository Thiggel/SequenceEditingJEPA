## Current Operational Read

Grid 3B rollout `N=2` improved proximity, but it did not satisfy the pure
latent exact-solve gate. Job `3680021` reports latent terminal-energy planning
solve `4/64`, filled-board terminal rate `26/64`, and mean remaining Hamming
`2.453`. Re-encoded symbolic-state planning still solves `64/64`.

Compared with the lead large diagnostics (`3680019`), rollout `N=2` cuts
terminal-energy mismatches from 299 to 157 and reduces drift at 10/20 oracle
steps from `0.079/1.742` to `0.041/1.495`. Terminal weighted latent drift is
not fixed (`2.014 -> 2.163`), so the main interpretation still holds: under
oracle-goal diagnostics, the action scorer is sufficient when candidate boards
are re-encoded, while stale latent rollout remains the bottleneck. The result
is not deployable because it still uses the oracle goal and because latent and
re-encoded planner samples are not paired example-by-example.

Grid 3C reset-cadence diagnostics (`3682924`) passed the mechanism gate. On
paired 64-board samples, no-reset terminal-energy planning solved `2/64`, reset
every 2 and 4 actions solved `64/64` under both step- and terminal-energy
selection, reset every 8/16 actions solved `64/64` only with terminal-energy
selection, and full re-encoded planning solved `64/64`. This supports keeping
symbolic boards as the planner state of record and periodically re-encoding the
latent state, before any model-size or Maze expansion.

Planning intentionally allows overwrites/conflicts on mutable Sudoku cells for
diagnosis, so terminal boards can be fully filled but wrong. Treat online
H1/H2/H4, terminal fill rate, and oracle-goal reset results as diagnostics, not
deployable solve quality. Generated analysis artifacts live under
`../sequence-editing-report/assets/grid3b/`, including the new Grid 3C
reset-cadence planning plots, CSVs, and concrete paired examples.

Grid 3D reset-large confirmation (`3683903`) is running against
`$PUZZLE_JEPA_WORK_ROOT/runs/sudoku_jepa_5m_local_direct_weighted_rollout_n2`,
writing `diagnostics_reset_cadence_large/`. It compares no reset, reset every
4/8 actions, and full re-encoded planning on 128 paired boards. Partition
housekeeping at 05:30 CEST: `3683903` and current oversight `3683472` are
running on `a100`, and the only later oversight `3683863` is begin-time-blocked.
No partition broadening is useful for running or begin-time-blocked repo jobs.

Oversight uses `scripts/oversight/puzzle_oversight_prompt.md`. That prompt
requires each run to reconcile Slurm/artifacts with the backlog, inspect
concrete planner examples, question assumptions, add useful report figures and
tables, fix/resubmit small failures, and keep the four-hour oversight chain
alive. The next safe step is to analyze `3683903` when it completes, not Maze
or broad capacity sweeps.
